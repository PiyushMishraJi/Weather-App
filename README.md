# This is a project for weather detection using API. 
<br>
We can check the details like temperature, speed of wind, clouds and images according to the location entered by the user. This project is implemented with the help of an API(Open Weather Map) which is used to fetch the real time data required and with this data we will be generating multiple information related to the location. Also this app has been implemented in such a manner that it will give user a great experience while using, also it gives different errors and alerts if the user enter the incorrect location or a null value in location.
